# hgtc-capstone-project
The project is representative of the senior capstone that I created during the final semester of my associates degree. The entire codebase for the project was written in JavaScript using a variety of the technologies that were available at the time. The back-end web server was built using the Express application framework for the node.js runtime while the front-end was created and rendered using the React.js UI framework. 


### Important Notes
This project is no longer under active development.
